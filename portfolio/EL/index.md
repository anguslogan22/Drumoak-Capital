## Thesis  

Walking past the beauty counter this spring felt surreal: a blue-chip house like Estée Lauder was priced like a broken biotech.  
Forward P/E had slipped into the mid-teens—levels we last saw during the 2008-09 trough—while the rest of the staples complex still traded at ~25 ×.  
Michael Burry surfacing with a long position was the push I needed to size up: when the man who shorted the housing bubble sees asymmetric upside in lip gloss, I at least run the numbers.

The numbers looked absurdly forgiving.  Even after China’s luxury hangover and tariff noise, core brands were still throwing off cash, and management hadn’t torched the balance sheet chasing growth.  
If the *Lipstick Index* is only half-myth, the optionality on a consumer rebound was free; if it’s total fiction, the valuation already discounted it.  
I pencilled in a *margin-of-safety* wide enough to drive a delivery truck of gift-with-purchase sets through—and hit the buy button.

I added again the next day when the tape printed another red candle.  Rarely do you get a best-in-class franchise with a private-equity entry multiple on public markets.  I’m happy to sit on this until the mirror fog clears—or until L’Oréal sneezes a bid.

## Risk / Exit Plan  

* **China headwinds worsen.**  If mainland sales growth stays < 5 % YoY for two consecutive quarters, I’ll trim 50 %.  
* **Management shuffle.**  Any surprise CEO/CFO departure is an automatic re-eval; I don’t stay if the bench looks thin.  
* **Thesis creep.**  If I catch myself pitching “hims & hers is the new EL” instead of EL’s own recovery story, position gets halved.  
* Hard stop at **-25 %** on the blended entry price—capital is finite, ego is optional.
