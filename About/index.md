## Who’s behind the screen?  

Hi — I’m **Angus Logan**, a second-year B.Com student at **McGill University** majoring in **Finance** and minoring in **Statistics**.  
When I’m not on the varsity soccer pitch, I’m knee-deep in price data, coding back-tests, or helping run:

* **Associate Director, Corporate Relations – McGill Ventures**  
* **Co-Founder / Co-President – McGill Athletes in Business**

Thistle Point Capital (TPC) is my public trading notebook: live positions, algorithms that don’t hide their warts, and brutally honest post-mortems.
